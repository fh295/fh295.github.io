## Building a situation representation

First, think about whether this sentence makes sense or not.

Now read the sentence again. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *__The haystack was important because the cloth ripped__*

Most people say that after clicking on the link, then reading the sentence, it now makes sense to them.

The context on which language understanding depends is very often perceptual or social. Understanding language involves constructing a representation of a scene based on how we understand the world.
