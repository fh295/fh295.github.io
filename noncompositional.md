# NonCompositional

A Twitter-length blog about language and cognition. Written in a rush, because time flies like an arrow (whereas fruit flies like a banana). 

Each entry is also a chain of Tweets. To respond and engage, just [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/felixhill84?lang=en)

### Building a situation representation

First, think about whether this sentence makes sense or not.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The haystack was important because the cloth ripped*

Most people say it seems grammatical but is incoherent. Perhaps it was generated by a (badly-tuned) neural language model!  

Now [click here](parachute.md) before reading on.

Hello again. Take another look at that sentence. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The haystack was important because the cloth ripped*

Most people say that after clicking on the link, the sentence now makes sense to them.

The context on which language understanding depends is very often perceptual or social. Understanding language involves constructing a representation of a scene based on how we understand the world.

### Top-down vs. bottom-up

How we interpret any language sequence depends on (1) what's in that sequence (2) the immediate "context" around that sequence *and* (3) our knowledge of how the world works. Look here:

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="letterperception.png">
</p>

We read the ambiguous highlighted character as 'w' in one context and 'ev' in another. Phrase or word perceptions depend trivially on letter perceptions but crucially letter perceptions also depend on word or phrase perceptions. The dependency goes both up *and* down the stack of abstraction. 

This isn't a special quirk of reading and orthography. Top-down effects also affact how we hear sounds. Look here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These break my brain <a href="https://t.co/0tgko0BBm6">pic.twitter.com/0tgko0BBm6</a></p>&mdash; The Layman&#39;s Linguist (@LaymansLinguist) <a href="https://twitter.com/LaymansLinguist/status/1212778825697939456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Help me out here: what's compositional about that?

### Word disorder

Languages differ in the extent to which the order of words affects the meaning. 

For English it's pretty important. In *man bites dog*, *man* being first tells us that the man did the biting. But this could also be marked directly on the words, e.g. with inflections (*bites dog man<sub>itwasme!</sub>*).

The Australian language Warlpiri has entirely arbitrary word order. When you ask a Warlpiri native speaker to repeat an utterance directly back to you, more often than not they alter the word order, apparently without realizing.

When you think about it, that's kind of wild! They just don't notice the word order, it doesn't enter their memory. A bit like when we as English speakers can't hear the difference between *bruder* (German for 'brother') and *brüder* ('brothers').

Latin is a free-word-order language too. So Nero or Augustus might have had the same 'disorder'.

### Polysynthetic languages

[Ray Mooney](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/) famously doubted whether [the meaning of a sentence could fit into a single vector](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/cramming.html), but polysynthetic languages cram the meaning of a sentence into a single word.

In the Australian language Bininj Gun-wok, *abanyawoihwarrgahmarneganjginjeng* means (approximately) "I cooked the wrong meat for them again."

In Cayuga, an American language, *Ęskakhehna’táyęthwahs* means "I will plant potatoes for them again."

In Yupik, a Siberian language, *tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq* means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer."

Polysynthetic languages are not an exceptional isolated occurrence. They are  more frequent in the Americas, Australia, Siberia, and New Guinea, but can be found in other places too. 

Does it make sense to say that these languages have a single word for a whole sentence? Who defines what a word is? 

Well, like words in English, speakers agree on exactly where they begin and end, and unlike sentences in English, they agree exactly on where any stress should be placed, and they don't accept periods of pause in the middle.

### My favourite treatments of compositionality in the literature


[Compositionality](
https://adele.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/277/2019/12/Compositionality-Routledge.pdf) by [Adele Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_Goldberg_(linguist))

[A Case for Deep Learning in Semantics](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/temp/pater-commentary-by-potts.pdf) by [Christopher Potts](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/)

&nbsp; .... <sub>*The usual story is that compositionality is crucial to our ability
to produce and understand creative new combinations of linguistic units, because it offers
guarantees about the systematicity and predictability of new units. However, these observations alone do not imply compositionality. The interpretation of a given phrase could be
systematic, predictable, and also determined in part by global properties of the utterance,
the speaker, the discourse situation, and so forth. And, indeed, it seems to me that our
everyday experiences with language are in keeping with this. Listeners greedily use all sorts
of information when making sense of others’ utterances, and speakers assume they will do
this.*</sub> ...
