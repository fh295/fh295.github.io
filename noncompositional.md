# NonCompositional

A Twitter-length blog about language and cognition. Written in a rush, because time flies like an arrow (whereas fruit flies like a banana).

### Building a situation representation

First, think about whether this sentence makes sense or not.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The haystack was important because the cloth ripped*

Most people say it seems grammatical but is incoherent. Perhaps it was generated by a (badly-tuned) neural language model!  

Now [click here](parachute.md) before reading on.

Hello again. Take another look at that sentence. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The haystack was important because the cloth ripped*

Most people say that after clicking on the link, the sentence now makes sense to them.

The context on which language understanding depends is very often perceptual or social. Understanding language involves constructing a representation of a scene based on how we understand the world.

### Top-down vs. bottom-up

How we interpret any language sequence depends on (1) what's in that sequence (2) the immediate "context" around that sequence *and* (3) our knowledge of how the world works. Look here:

  <img width="600" src="letterperception.png">
</p>

We read the ambiguous highlighted character as 'w' in one context and 'ev' in another. Phrase or word perceptions depend trivially on letter perceptions but crucially letter perceptions also depend on word or phrase perceptions. The dependency goes both up *and* down the stack of abstraction. 

This isn't a special quirk of reading and orthography. Top-down effects also affact how we hear sounds. Look here:

Help me out here: what's compositional about that?

### Word disorder

Languages differ in the extent to which the order of words affects the meaning. 

For English it's pretty important. In *man bites dog*, *man* being first tells us that the man did the biting. But this could also be marked directly on the words, e.g. with inflections (*bites dog man<sub>itwasme!</sub>*).

The Australian language Warlpiri has entirely arbitrary word order. When you ask a Warlpiri native speaker to repeat an utterance directly back to you, more often than not they alter the word order, apparently without realizing.

When you think about it, that's kind of wild! They just don't notice the word order, it doesn't enter their memory. A bit like when we as English speakers can't hear the difference between *bruder* (German for 'brother') and *br√ºder* ('brothers').

Latin is a free-word-order language too. So Nero or Augustus might have had the same 'disorder'.
