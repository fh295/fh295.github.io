I am a Research Scientist at DeepMind. 

My work aims to replicate in artificial systems how we as humans learn, process, represent and use semantic concepts and language. 

### Research Themes

#### Embodied language learning

Children learn to understand language at the same time they learn to perceive, interact-with, explain and make predictions about the world around them. Evidence suggests that our linguistic knowledge depends critically on sensory-motor and perceptual representations and processes, which in turn are influenced and shaped by our language. My work simulates this process of acquiring language jointly with perceptual and motor processes as a path to realistic language understanding in fully embodied systems. We have found that systems capable of acquiring abstract knowledge via interaction with data of multiple modalities should, like humans, exploit multiple complementary learning algorithms.

#### Perception and abstraction

A child might learn what growing means by observing a sibling, a pet or a plant get physically bigger, but once understood, the same idea of growing can be applied to pocket money, a tummy ache or Dad’s age. This ability to represent relations, principles or ideas like ‘growing’ with sufficient abstraction that they can be flexibly (re-)applied in disparate, and potentially unfamiliar, contexts and domains is central to human cognition and language.  Our work has shown that this ability can be replicated in distributed learning systems like neural networks, but that particular algorithms and training experience are required to induce representations of sufficient abstraction. 

#### Language understanding from textual and linguistic resources

Before I joined Deepmind, I worked on XXX



##### Other stuff

I was once asked in a job interview “what sort of researcher are you?’. I didn’t have authoritative answer, and, on reflection, I hope I never do. Categories are useful for some things, but I don’t think they should be used to group people into tribes or otherwise reach quick conclusions about work.
